# Specification Quality Checklist: User Authentication with JWT Tokens

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All validation items pass. Spec is ready for planning.
- The spec appropriately focuses on user needs and security requirements without prescribing frameworks.
- Success criteria are measurable (time, percentage, concurrency) and user-focused.
- Edge cases cover security, rate limiting, token security, and failure modes comprehensively.
- Scope is clearly bounded: authentication only (not profile management, not email delivery).
- Assumptions section clearly documents dependencies and environment expectations.
